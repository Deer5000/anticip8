## Description

            This is a new project that I am working on. Anticip8 will show live data of breaking news happening here in the U.S as well as the current stock market. I will use this information as well as data from similar events that has happened in the past to compare and predict which way the market will move. I want to do this project to help bring peace and stability to the economy and most importantly the people.

## Challenges I Anticipate

            1.) Scraping data from credible news outlets.
            2.) Displaying the information in the most user-friendly way.

## Bike

Displaying the information in a user friendly way, determining the conditions of the current stock market (Good, Bad, neutral), and generating a graph based off of the current condition.

## Car
